## Deploy API server

```sh
$ flask --app api/api run -h localhost -p 8080
```

## Prerequisites for running Kafka

- Docker<br>
  Make sure Docker Desktop is running in background (if you're on windows/mac). if you face any issues with docker on terminal, maybe try logging in first?
  ```sh
      $ docker login -u <docker_username> -p <docker_password>
  ```
- confluent-kafka

```sh
$ pip install confluent-kafka
```

#### Steps

<br>

1. Start Kafka Stack.

```sh
$ docker compose up --build
```

<br>

2. Run the _docker_topics.py_ file.

```sh
$ python docker_topics.py
```

<br>

3. Start the flask _api.py_ file.

```sh
$ flask --app api run
```

<br>

4. Run the simple consumer _basic.py_ file.

```sh
$ python basic.py
```

<br>

5. Run the api _spammer.py_ file.

```sh
$ python spammer.py
```

<br>

Good to go :D

<br>
P.S: When you're done, use

```sh
$ docker compose down
```

<br>

_or_

<br>

```sh
$ docker compose down -v
```

This one in particular removes the containers and clears the persistent data in the volume so no useless logs remain or are persisted.

<br>

## --IN PARTICULAR FOR POSTGRESQL AND PGADMIN--

Our main library to interact with postgresql.

```sh
$ pip install psycopg2
```

<br>

- Run the docker compose file as mentioned previously.
- Run the docker_topics.py file.
- Run _postgre_schema.py_

```sh
$ python run postgre_schema.py
```

This creates the tables in the database, ready to be filled with logs.

<br>

pgadmin is a postegresql visualisation tool (GUI basically) that helps you verify if everything's fine.
To access that:

- Go to localhost:8080
- email: admin@admin.com <br>
  password: admin
- Click on 'Add New Server'. (unless somehow it already exists there on left sidebar o_o)
- Give a name for your Server.
- Move to the "Connection Tab". <br>

  Hostname: postgres <br>
  Port: 5432 <br>
  Maintenance Database: logs_db <br>
  username: admin <br>
  password: password

- Save.

You got it :) <br> You can navigate to the server, look for logs_db and check if everything's fine. You can also run sql commands by clicking on logs_db and navigating towards the 'cylinder with a triangle' icon. That's your Query Tool (essentially SQL shell). Run commands. Check if logs are present. Have a bun samosa üçî

(Should misfortune befall you, here's a 15 min video on using pgadmin: https://youtu.be/WFT5MaZN6g4?si=36_71O4zve2JD7vC)

## --PLAYING WITH PROMETHEUS AND GRAFANA--

- docker-compose.yml has been updated to accommodate Prometheus and Grafana.
- You might need prometheus_client, just on the safer side.
  <br>

```sh
$ pip install prometheus_client
```

<br>

- You'll need to follow the same previous steps of setting up all the necessary files.

- Configure Prometheus

  - Log into Prometheus via localhost:9090
  - Go to status -> Targets. Ensure api.py is running.
  - Perfect, we can move to Grafana.
    <br>

- Configure Grafana
  - Log into Grafana via localhost:3000
  - email: admin <br>
    password: admin <br>
    (you'll be prompted to set a new password, if you want, you could)
  - You'll now have to add a data source (prometheus basically)
  - Connections -> Search for Prometheus -> Add new Data Source
  - You can give it a name <br>
    URL: http://prometheus:9090
  - Scroll down and click "Save and Test" to confirm its working.
  - Navigate to Dashboards
  - Create Dashboards
    <br>
    Good to go :D
